    Singleton class to use the same aiohttp ClientSession for all http requests.

    Question:   Why same ClientSession ?
    Answer  :   ref : https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_quickstart.html
                Donâ€™t create a session per request.
                Most likely you need a session per application which performs all requests altogether.
                A session contains a connection pool inside.
                Connection reusage and keep-alives (both are on by default) may speed up total performance.
